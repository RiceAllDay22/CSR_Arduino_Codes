# CSR_Arduino_Codes

This repository contains guides, codes, schematics, and datasheets for operating various sensors and modules. The Individual_Modules folder includes projects that focus on only one electronic component, such as a CO2 sensor. The Data_Loggers folder contains projects that combine multiple modules to create a device for collecting data. Lastly, the projects housed in the Miscellaneous_Modules folder are not intended for data logging but still utilize numerous components to achieve a purpose.
