# CSR_Arduino_Codes

The CSR_Arduino_Collection repository contains guides, codes, schematics, and datasheets for operating various sensors and modules. The Individual_Modules folder includes projects that focus on only one electronic component, such as a CO2 sensor. The Data_Loggers folder contains projects that combine multiple modules to create a device for collecting data. Lastly, the projects housed in the Miscellaneous_Modules folder are not intended for data logging but still utilize numerous components to achieve a purpose.

This repository aims to support the WirelessSensorNetwork (WSN) project found at https://github.com/jkub6/WirelessSensorNetwork. WSN utilizes various electrical modules, most notably CO2 sensors. So having a repository that covers each one in greater detail may prove valuable. 

Every code in CSR_Arduino_Collection is given the MIT license, which is a very permissive software license. Basically, any code found in the repository is able to be used and changed freely, as long as the original license notice is included in any copies of the software. A copy of this license is included in this repository under the name LICENSE.md

The CSR_Arduino_Collection project and the WirelessSensorNetwork project are led by Adriann Liceralde under the leadership of Dr. Brian McPherson from the Carbon Science Research group at the University of Utah. Any questions, comments, or concerns are welcome to be sent to adriann8399@gmail.com.

Notable contributors to the project are Jacob Larkin, Charlie Leo, Tessa Bailey, Sean Taplin, and Andrew Winkelmann.
