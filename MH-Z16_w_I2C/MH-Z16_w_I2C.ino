INTRODUCTION
  This code is for the MH-Z16 CO2 sensor (black cylinder shape).
  The sensor must be connected to the blue UART-I2C adaptor for this code to work.
  Ensure that the wiring is correct before running the code and powering the Arduino.
  The blue adaptor has a switch. Make sure it is set to I2C mode. 
  Any line(s) in this code may be copied and pasted into other Arduino codes, as desired.

IMPORTANT NOTES
  Do not expose sensor directly to sunlight.
  Do not expose sensor in water or rainy conditions.

WIRING
  Adaptor  -> Arduino
  ------------------------
  GND Pin  -> GND  Port
  VCC Pin  -> 5.0V Port
  SDA Pin  -> SDA  Port
  SCL Pin  -> SCL  Port
  Refer to external png file for a picture of the wiring.

CALIBRATION
  There is a white button on the blue adaptor.
  Once the sensor has been in a stable condition for a few minutes, hold the button for 10 seconds.
  The sensor will then start giving readings around 400 ppm.
  Performing a calibration will always force the sensor to give 400 ppm readings. 

SPECIFICATIONS
  Collection Frequency is normally set to 1 second but can be increased or decreased.
  Measurement Range is 0 to 5000 ppm.
  Accuracy is Â± (50 ppm + 5% of the Measured Value)
  Current Consumption is 60 mA.
