The MultiCU1106 is a circuit that operates four versions of the CU1106 family of CO2 sensors: the CU-1106-C, the CU-1106H-NS, the CU-1106SL-NS, and the CU-1106SL-N. The purpose of this circuit is to simultaneously assess the performances of the CO2 sensors. Results of the assessment are found in https://github.com/RiceAllDay22/WirelessSensorNetwork/tree/master/Section1-Prototyping/Assessment-CU1106
